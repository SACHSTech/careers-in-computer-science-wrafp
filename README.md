Video game making is something I have been eager to do and learn since I was young, and as such is the job I have picked for this research assignment. The role of a developer is to collaborate with others in order to design games. Oftentimes, they will attend meetings and workshops to improve upon their product and hopefully achieve commercial success. Generally college diploma is generally required, but most important is a portfolio based on your previous experiences and programming knowledge.  



### Skills Needed
* Programming - Being able to code
* Active listening - Being attentive to hear other opinions
* Complex problem solving - Evaluating different methods and solving problems
* Critical thinking - Using logic and reasoning to identify issues
* Reading comprehension - Understanding written works and documentation
* Artistic Talent - To create unique and memorable aspects in the game

* Salary: 38-76k (low to high) according to myBlueprint
